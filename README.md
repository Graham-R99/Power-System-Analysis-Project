# Power-System-Analysis-Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Power System Analysis project completed in MATLAB for an electric power systems or power engineering course. The goal of the project was to implement key analysis tools used in electrical power network studies using MATLAB scripting.

The project focuses on modeling, analysis, and visualization of power system behavior, including load flow and related steady-state computations — foundational techniques in electric power engineering.
## Project Overview
Power system analysis is a core part of electrical engineering that evaluates the performance and behavior of electrical power networks. This project:

- Implements computational tools to analyze power flow in a predefined network

- Calculates voltages, power injections, and line characteristics

- Demonstrates steady-state network behavior under given load and generation conditions

The results help visualize how power flows through the system and ensure stable operation under normal conditions.

## What the Code Does

The core routines in this project typically:

- Build the system admittance (Y-bus) matrix

- Solve the load-flow equations for bus voltages and angles

- Compute real and reactive power flows based on network topology and loads

- Generate plots summarizing electrical state variables (voltages, power, etc.)

These methods align with standard load flow analysis used in power system planning and operation.
